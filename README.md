Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.

Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

Comparative Analysis Prompt
Definition: Asking for a comparison between two or more concepts, often highlighting similarities and differences.
•	"Compare and contrast deep learning and machine learning."
•	"How do renewable and non-renewable energy sources differ?"

Experiential Perspective Prompt:
> 	“As a software engineer, what are the benefits of using cloud computing in your projects?”
>  “From a student’s perspective, describe the challenges of online learning.”

Everyday Functioning Prompts:
*	  “Describe the role of machine learning in everyday apps like YouTube or Netflix."
*	 	“How is encryption used in daily life when sending WhatsApp messages?”

Universal Prompt Structures:
^ 	“Explain [concept] in simple terms with an example.”
^  “Explain the process of [task] step by step.”

Prompt Size Limitations:
&  	“Translate this 5000-word essay into Tamil.”
→ Manageable chunks: “Translate the first 1000 words into Tamil, then continue.”
&  “Give me 50 examples of AI applications.”




Prompt engineering Types

Prompt Type	Description	Example Prompt	Explanation / Use Case
1. Straightforward Prompting	A direct and simple prompt that asks the AI exactly what you want, without giving extra context or examples.	🗣️ “Summarize the article on blockchain technology in 100 words.”	This is the most basic form of prompting — easy to use and fast, but may lack depth or accuracy if the task is complex. Best for short, factual, or general questions.
2. Tabular Format Prompting	The prompt instructs the AI to organize information in a table (rows and columns). This improves clarity, comparison, and readability.	🗣️ “List the advantages and disadvantages of blockchain technology in a table format with two columns.”	Useful for structured output like comparisons, pros & cons, data summaries, or evaluation results. Helps students quickly grasp key differences.
3. Missing Word Prompting	The prompt contains an incomplete sentence or blank, encouraging the AI to fill in the missing information based on context.	🗣️ “Blockchain ensures data integrity through a ______ mechanism.” → (AI fills: ‘consensus’)	Helps test AI’s understanding or knowledge recall. Commonly used in quizzes, fill-in-the-blank exercises, and language learning tasks.
4. Preceding Question Prompting	The AI is first given a related or guiding question before the main question, helping it reason or narrow down context for better answers.	🗣️ “What is the main goal of blockchain technology? Now explain how decentralization achieves that goal.”	Encourages step-by-step reasoning. Useful for educational and reasoning-based tasks — improves coherence and logical flow of answers.

Summary
Straight forward prompts → direct and simple.
Tabular prompts → structured and easy to compare.
Missing word prompts → test AI’s knowledge or understanding.
Preceding question prompts → guide the AI’s reasoning path.


→ Adjust for size: “Give me 10 AI applications at a time.”
